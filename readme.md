# Awesome Software Architecture<br/>
  
[![awesome-badge](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
  
[Software architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architecture) aims to describe the high level 
structures of software as well as the discipline of creating them. As this topic is pretty broad, it might 
contain some resources that are also present in more niche lists.
